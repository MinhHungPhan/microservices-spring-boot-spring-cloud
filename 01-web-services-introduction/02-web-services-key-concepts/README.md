## Introduction

In the previous sections, we discussed what web services are and their key components. We established that a web service:

1. Supports application-to-application interaction.
2. Is platform-independent.
3. Allows communication over a network.

This section will discuss "how" these web services operate, focusing on data exchange, platform independence, and service definition.

## How Data Exchange Occurs

Data exchange in web services is all about requests and responses. Let's consider a simple example:

We have a mobile application (App A) that uses a weather web service. App A sends a request to this service for weather data of "New York City". The service, upon receiving and processing the request, gathers the relevant weather data and sends it back to App A as a response.

                            │                    │─────────────────────▶│                    │
                            │   Application A    │                      │    Web Service     │
                            │                    │◀─────────────────────│                    │
                            │                    │       Response       │                    │
                            └────────────────────┘                      └────────────────────┘

This process of sending a request and receiving a response constitutes the basis of data exchange in web services.

## Platform Independence

Web services need to be platform-independent. That means we should be able to call our web service from a Java application, a .NET application, or a PHP application. To achieve this, both the request and the response need to be platform-independent, which means they need to be in formats supported by all different platforms.

## Request and Response Formats

Two popular formats exist for requests and responses:

1. **XML (Extensible Markup Language)**: XML can be generated from any platform, whether Java, .NET, or others. It uses nodes to specify details, making it a popular choice for request and response in web services.

XML Response Example:

```xml
<book>
  <title>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone</title>
  <author>J.K. Rowling</author>
  <year>1997</year>
</book>
```

2. **JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)**: Originally JavaScript's way of representing objects, JSON is now supported by various platforms, both front-end and back-end systems like Java, .NET, and more.

JSON Response Example:

```json
{
  "book": {
    "title": "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone",
    "author": "J.K. Rowling",
    "year": "1997"
  }
}
```

Using these universally supported formats allows the web service to be platform-independent.

## Service Definition

The service definition specifies the format and structure of requests and responses. It also details how a consumer can create a request and what the response's structure will be. Moreover, it provides the endpoint information, i.e., where the service is available. This information allows Application A (or any consumer) to use the web service effectively.
